# Student-Outcome-Analysis
A Final Project for my Machine Learning class at UCLA Extension.
This dataset from the UCI Repository has 36 predictors - the most I've used for ML. Metrics started rather low in the high 60s to high 70s, even while using optimal hyperparameters for Random Forest, XGBoost and Dense Neural Network.

My strategy was to use Recursive Feature Elimination, Chi Squared Test, PCA and Factor Analyzer among others to improve metrics.

Received 100/100 for my efforts but I continued to refine my code after submission with another RFE, manual feature elimination (based on findings from histograms, boxplots, chi squared test and even VIF). And finally succeeded in making Dense Neural Network results reproducible!

Will continue to iterate as I think this dataset is quite challenging.
